### 🤖 AI Anomaly Detection
The log statistics reveal highly suspicious activity, predominantly characterized by a concentrated and malicious traffic source. All 22 unique IPs observed were flagged as malicious, generating 16,150 requests, with a significant proportion being 301 redirects, alongside notable 400 (Bad Request), 403 (Forbidden), and 500 (Internal Server Error) responses. This pattern suggests a coordinated, low-and-slow reconnaissance or attack campaign from known threat actors targeting the web server's structure and attempting to exploit vulnerabilities.
